# Modify-Date Joomla! plugin
The easiest way to edit the modification date of an article in Joomla! 4 and beyond.

Until now, the only solution to change the modification date of an article in Joomla, is to go through the database. This technique is reserved for people with the access rights and skills to do so.

The Modify Date plugin has been specially designed to allow you to modify this field directly from the Joomla administration panel, without having to intervene in the database. Thus, you have complete control over your site and how your articles are displayed. Read the documentation [here](https://web-eau.net/en/development/modify-date/documentation).
